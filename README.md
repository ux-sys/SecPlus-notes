# SecPlus-notes
A systems perspective on Security + cert by CompTIA.

Domains:
1 General foundational security concepts
2 Threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigations
3 Security architecture (The layout and topology of the organization. Mostly planning phase)
4 Security operations (Day to day actual cyber work related to employees, like SOC, MDM, etc)
5 Lawyer, Manager, Accounting, and Finance perspective on cyber (mostly business and financial plans, also legal agreements)

  1 The base network IT infrastructure
    Terms:
      Standard (formal guidelines on how protocols should work. Eg SSH is protocol that states connection must be encrypted, but RFC 4251 specifies to use RSA. Example)
        Standards by different orgs: RFC (IETF), IEEE 802.1q,  ISO/IEC #, ITU-T (Telecom and global networking), (Microsoft works with other orgs to develop standards, but they themselves publish technical specs for Microsoft products to implement the standard, MS-XXXX: ProtocolName)
          Protocol (A protocol is a set of rules to communicate)
      Software (an implementation of a specific protocol)
      Software stack (Multiple software working together to achieve a specific purpose)
